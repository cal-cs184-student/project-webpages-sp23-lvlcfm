		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			What this project entails is going through the implementation of a real-time simulation of cloth. In this project
			I learned about implmenting a mass and spring based system and building the data structures that can represent
			cloth that ultimattely allowed me to implement collission detetction, that is, self-collisions, allowing the cloth
			to collide with itself. And ultimately I learned how to implement shaders, that is, making the simulation look as
			close as to what we see in the real world. A labor of love. And so, Team Bobbin weaves you into this next and
			final project.
		</p>

		<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Masses and springs</h2>
		<h3>
			Take some screenshots of scene/pinned2.json from a viewing angle where you can clearly see the cloth wireframe to
			show the structure of your point masses and springs.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration </h2>
		<h3>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P,
			modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any
			time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.</h3>
		<h3>
			Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very
			low ks? A high ks?
		</h3>
		<p>
			when there is a low ks, it behaves like a very “slow”, “sluggish” piece of cloth. It’s more rigid, we don’t see
			any movement throughout the cloth as we move it
		</p>
		<p>
			when there is a high ks, we can see waves moving throughout the cloth from beginning till the end. Perhaps we can
			say it adds a bit more fluidity to the cloth itself.
		</p>
		<h3>What bout for density?</h3>
		<p>as the density is smaller, the simulation of the cloth dropping feels “lighter”, it also does not stretch as
			much.
		</p>
		<p>
			as the density gets larger, the simulation of the cloth feels “heavier”, for as we increase the density we already
			notice at the beginning it “droops” lower, giving the look of a tanktop.
		</p>
		<h3>
			What about damping?
		</h3>
		<p>
			When the damping is increased, we see the cloth take more of a feather-like effectt.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the damping is decreased, we see the cloth falling with more force, faster.
		</p>
		<h3>
			For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show
			us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.

			I’ll point out one interesting observation — the absense of waves. That is, I increase the density to 45 g/cm^2
			and the spring constant ks to 10,000 N/m and the damping to 0.758621% and when the simulation plays, every thing
			is still — the whole cloth, sort of an anti-animation set of settings.

		<h4>when ks is increased to 500 N/m</h4>

			When KS is increased to 5000 we begin to notice that the folds are bigger right as they are coming to the ground
			and folding into itself.
		</p>
		<h4>when ks is decreased to 500 N/m</h4>
		<p>
			When KS is decreased to 500 N/m we notice the structure of the folds as they are forming at the bottom begin to
			lose structure and are not as well formed.
		</p>
		<h4>when density is increased to 150 g/cm^2</h4>
		<p>
			When density is increased to (150 g/cm^2) the folds are tighter, smaller and less movement as it falls onto
			itself, it is more self contained.
		</p>
		<h4>When density is decreased to 150 g/cm^2</h4>
		<p>
			When I decrease the density to 5 g/cm^2less dense it explodes, there’s a certain density where it becomes unstable
			and does not fold properly unto itself, in short - it does not reach a resting state. I show the before the folds
			explode and after.

		<h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders </h2>
		<h3>
			Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create
			lighting and material effects.
		</h3>
		<p>
			A shader program is a computer program that runs on the graphics processing unit (GPU) and is responsible for
			computing the colors of each pixel or vertex in a 3D scene. Vertex shaders are used to apply transforms to each
			vertex, modifiying their geometric properties like position and normal vectors. This allows us to transform 3d
			models between different spaces, that is from local space, world space and camera space, enabling us to correctly
			render a scene in terms of position, rotation and scale.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, fragment shaders are responsible for computing the color of each pixel, that is, Fragment
			Shaders, take in fragments which are geometric attributes and compute and write a color to that fragment. Fragment
			Shaders use lighting, material properties and textures to help determine the final color of each pixel.
		</p>
		<p>
			That is, the vertex shader program takes charge of geometric transformations and fragment shaders, take these
			geometric transformations and apply color to them based on these geometric transfomrations to ultimately create
			complex lighting and material effects that make 3D scenes look more realistic and immersive.
		</p>
		<h3>Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. </h3>
		<p>
			I think the best way to describe Blinn-Phong shading model is by comparing it to Lambertian (Diffuse) Shading,
			where in Lambertian Shading, shading is independent of view direction which produces a matte appearance. But for
			Blinn-Phong shading (i.e specular shading) the intensity depends on the view direction, making what we see on the
			sphere “bright” near the mirror reflection direction. We do this by taking into account the ambient light
			component and specular reflection component in addition to the diffuse lighting.

			They look amazing. By changing the coarseness to 16 we begin to see that it makes the material more metal like.
