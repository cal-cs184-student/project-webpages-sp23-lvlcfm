      As Kadinsky once said “everything starts from a dot”. And what is implemented in this project builds upon that
      quote by exploring topics on geometric modeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project I implemented Bezier curves and extended this to surfaces being able to render teapots. That is,
      we could sip our tea and render it as well. That is, I implemented what could be described as the beginning stages
      of the pen tool on Adobe’s Illustrator or on Adobe’s Figma by using de Casteljau’s subdivision algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      After bezier curves and surfaces I move on to implementing area-weighted vertex normals, which enabled us to apply
      Phong shading, which made our teapot look tea time ready. Building upon area-weighted vertex normals, I then
      implemented two local remeshing operations - the edge flip and the split edge, which allowed us to make
      interesting decor patterns on our teapot. This allowed me to do a deep dive in learning about manipulating
      triangle meshes which are represented by half-edge data structures.
    </p>
    <p>And by taking these two local remeshing operations I then used them to implement Loop Subdivision for Mesh
      upsampling, which allowed us to take the shape of mesh and have it converge to a smooth approximation of its
      original version. Before, our tea was bitter, but with loop subdivision, the taste is now smooth, or atleast you
      can see how smooth the teapot is. That is, we can now make our mesh models “smooth” through the implementation of
      this technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully the torus at the beginning got you excited! So grab you a beverage of your choice as you are reading
      this, perhaps some tea and enjoy the rest.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


    <b>
      Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
    </b>
    <p>
      Let’s first describe De Casteljau's algorithm, which is a recursive method used to evaluate points on a Bezier
      curve. It is based on the concept of linear interpolation, and it allows us to determine the position of a point
      on a Bezier curve given a set of control points.

      To implement the algorithm, we first define a set of control points that define the shape of the curve. We then
      subdivide the curve into smaller segments using a parameter t that ranges from 0 to 1, where t=0 represents the
      starting point of the curve, and t=1 represents the end point.

      The algorithm works by computing a sequence of intermediate points, starting from the control points and moving
      towards the final point on the curve. At each step, we calculate a new set of points by interpolating between
      neighboring points on the previous level. We repeat this process until we reach the final point on the curve.

      To calculate the position of a point on the curve for a given value of t, we start by computing the intermediate
      points at the first level of subdivision. We then use these points to compute the intermediate points at the next
      level, and so on, until we reach the final point on the curve. The position of the point on the curve is then
      given by the last intermediate point computed.
    </p>
    <br>


    <b>
      Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing.
      Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.
    </b>
    <p>
      For implementing Casteljau’s algorithm, I implemented the `BezierCurve::evaluateStep(...)`. Which is a function
      that performs only one step of the algorithm, i.e, one level of subdivision. To accomplish this I first
      constructed a `lerp_casteljaul` helper function to calculate an intermediate control point (or the final
      interpolated vector) by having the helper function take in three parameters — two neighboring points `p_i` and
      `p_i_pp` and a parameter `t`.

      Using `lerp_casteljaul` within `BezierCurve:evaluateStep(...)` I took the points from the previous evaluation step
      (whether those points were the initial control points or the following intermediate control points from the
      previous level) and computed the next set of intermediate control points. If there was only 1 point that was being
      passed into the `BezierCurve:evaluateStep(...)` this meant it was the final interpolated vector and I just
      returned that value, if not, I would calculate the next set of intermediate control points.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
    <b>
      Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to
      evaluate Bezier surfaces.
    </b>
    <p>
      Casteljau’s algorithm can be extended to apply to Bezier surfaces. While in Part 1 we focused on on using
      Casteljau’s algorithm for calculating the position of a point within a single Bezier curve, parametrized by a
      value of t, we can now extend this idea to a Bezier surface.

      If we think of the surface as a grid of control points, that is an n x n grid of control points, where each
      surface point is defined by two parameters u and v, where u represents the position of a point in the horizontal
      direction and v in the vertical direction. And if we hold these control points in a matrix data structure, then
      what we can do is apply De Casteljau's algorithm in the u-direction in each row to obtain N control points
      interpolated on the value u. These N control points interpolated on the value `u` create our “moving bezier
      curve”. We these N control points interpolated in the `u` direction, we can then apply Casteljau’s algorithm in
      the v-direction to obtain the final point on the surface.

    <h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

    <b>
      Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
    </b>
    <p>
      To implement the area-weighted vertex normals, I used the half-edge data structure to iterate through faces
      (triangles) incident to the vertex. To iterate I used a for loop where I iterated on the “meta_edge” which allows
      me to iterate one face (triangle) at a time by calling “next()→next()→twin()”, having a terminating condition
      signaling when we have returned to the original vertex’s halfedge, which would result having processed all of the
      triangles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then divided the calculation in two steps — first obtaining the normal of a face (triangle) incident to the
      vertex and then calculated the area of that same face. Obtaining these two pieces I then took the product of the
      normal of the face and its area, where the area acts as a weight. To obtain the normal I took inspiration from
      halfEdgeMesh.cpp’s Face::normal function and used the cross products of the edges to obtain the normal. To obtain
      the area of the Face (triangle), I took the approach of the determinant, where I took a 3X3 matrix (Matrix3x3),
      placed the values of the 3 vertices in the matrix, took the determinant (ensuring it is positive) and multiplied
      it by .5 to obtain the area of the triangle using the determinant of a matrix. I then summed each of these
      area-weighted normals of the faces and returned a normalized value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have computed the normal vectors for each vertex, we can use them in the Phong shading algorithm to
      determine the color of each pixel on the mesh. By using area-weighted normal vectors, we can achieve smoother and
      more accurate shading on curved surfaces and in areas with varying face orientations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following show flat shading (without vertex normals) and Phong shading (with vertex normals).

    <h3>
      How do we implement edge flip operations?
    </h3>
    <p>
      I took inspiration directly from CMU’s “Guide to Implementing Edge Operations on a Halfedge Data Structure”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with “PHASE 0: Draw a Diagram”, because our implementation so far has been taking the counter-clock wise
      approach in regards to the traversal of half edges, I re-drew the before and after flip diagrams in a
      counter-clock fashion, where F0 (Face 0) is above and F1 (Face 1) is below. I must add, that this step is the most
      crucial step of this process, I’ll say more when I discuss debugging strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before collecting and reassigning any elements, I first wrote some pre-conditions to ensure that I was not
      flipping a boundary edge. If the current edge’s halfedge is in the boundary edge or its twin or its face or its
      twin’s face is in the boundary then we simply return the edge without any reassignments. I verified this visually
      by going through the Beetle model, took an edge on a boundary with a nice memory address, along with a friendly
      message to std::cout if it hit the condition that it was an edge, I attempted to flip it. With no flips, the
      pre-condition was confirmed to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I then moved to “PHASE I: Collect all the elements”, which means, in HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge(...) I translated the
      “BEFORE FLIP” diagram into code, that is, I took all the mesh elements in the diagram and assignmed them exactly
      as how I labeled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Phase II: Reassign Elements” — here I explicitly updated all the pointers for all the mesh elements, regardless
      if the flip operation affected them or not. This meant, taking the “AFTER FLIP” diagram and reassigning the
      existing mesh elements already assigned from “PHASE 1” to match the “AFTER FLIP” diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the pre-conditions met, and the mesh elements assigned exactly to match the “BEFORE FLIP” and then “AFTER
      FLIP”. We are able to flip edges correctly as shown below

    <h3>
      What are some interesting implementation / debugging tricks that I used? That is, my debuggning journey.
    </h3>
    <p>
      For this task, the most interesting implementation/debugging technique was drawing the diagram. I thought I was
      done with this task until began writing this written portion of the project. I wanted to make a point how I
      re-drew the half-edges to have them traversing clockwise, but only to notice that I didn’t do that with the faces.
      So I redrew it. Rewrote the code. Reassigned every mesh element, only to realize that I was missing an edge
      reassigment from the previous implementation which manifested itself as a missing edge, which initially (from a
      visual perspective) looked like expected behavior. But after reassigning the missing edge, everything worked
      beautifully and I began to notice the edge that was missing, was now there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A take away is — a mesh diagram/ map is only as good as the code that follows it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On another note, for implementing and confirming that the pre-conditions that I was checking for were working, I
      used the Beetle.dae to confirm that no edges that are on the boundary were flipped by attempting to flip it
      manually and also outputting a message to the terminal when I attempted to flip an unflippable edge.

    <h3>
      How do we implement edge split operations?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Similar to part 4 where I learned to implement flip edge operations, I took a similar approach where I took
      inspiration directly from CMU’s “Guide to Implementing Edge Operationson a Halfedge Data Structure”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again I drew out two diagrams of a local neighborhood of all the local mesh elements in a counter-clock-wise
      fashion, a diagram labeling all the elements before spliting the edge and a diagram labeling all the elements
      after splitting the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this implementation, I did add support for edge splits on edges that are on the boundary. In order to implement
      this feature, I also drew out two diagrams where the only 1 face was within the boundary. Using these diagrams I
      was able to reuse the code I wrote for one face for the other. The key difference was that the half-edge that
      would be initially used would either be the edge’s half-edge or the half-edge’s twin. The key part of this
      implementation was being able to select an edge AFTER a split. Initially when I was successful in splitting an
      edge on the boundary, I was only able to split 1 of the edges. This was due to the second half-edge not having its
      own proper twin that was in the boundary. I put the following diagram to help provide some context for this
      portion of the implementation.
    </p>
    <div align="middle">
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr align="center">
          <td>
            <img src="images/s2p5/Q5_split_with_boundary.png" align="middle" width="750px" />
            <figcaption>Edge split diagram with boundary</figcaption>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <p>
      So my solution was to create a “lambda” half-edge insert operation, where I would “downshift”, that is, reassingn
      h0’s (halfedge) twin (h3) to act as h9n’s twin. This allows me to “insert” a twin boundary half-edge in front of
      h3. I then created a new half-edge that would be h0’s twin. The main observation that led me to take this route
      was noting from the explanation of virtual boundary faces in the mesh boundaries <a
        href="https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/su20/docs/HalfEdgePrimer">document</a> and I quote “The entire virutal
      boundary face above is considered as a single face, as opposed to being composed of triangles. In other words, the
      boundary face is a single polygon with 12 edges!”. And so I extended this idea, by knowing that each of those
      edges’ half-edges’ have twins in the virtual face, and since it’s 1 face, when one extends an edge on one side,
      one can simply extend the other side in tandem. That is in this implementation, because I knew the new twin
      (half-edge) would share the same face as the half-edge that came after it, I was able to safely insert a half-edge
      into the existing face and assign and reassign all of its pointers and those elements that were affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      After collecting all of the elements in “Phase I: Collect all the elements”, which meant translating the “Before
      Split” diagram into code in HalfedgeMesh::flipEdge(...). I then moved on to “Phase Ib: Allocate New Elements”. If
      we look at the “AFTER SPLIT” diagram, all mesh elements labeled purple are the “new elements”. From the purple
      elements in the diagram, I created new mesh elements - 1 vertex, 3 edges, 6 halfedges and 2 faces. After creating
      these new elements, I moved on to “Phase II: Reassign Elements” — where I explicitly updated all of the points for
      all the mesh elemens, regardless if the split operation did not affect them or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the pointers explicitly reassigned, along with the precondition checks, I moved forward with carrying out
      some visual testing to confirm the implementation by doing a series of edge split operations and also combining
      the split operation with the edge flip operation.

    <h3>
      Context and summary of loop subdivision
    </h3>
    <p>
      For those tuning in for the first time, loop subdivision is a mesh upsampling method that is commonly used in
      computer graphics. At a high level it works by iteratively subdividing each face, that is a triangle, of the mesh
      into smaller faces (smaller triangles), and then adjusting the positions of the vertices to create a smoother
      surface. In this project’s approach our single loop subdivision operation consists of two main steps — Step 1. We
      apply a 4-1 subdivision where we subdivide a triangle in the mesh into four by connecting their edge midpoints.
      Step 2. We update the vertex positions as weighted average of neighboring vertex positions. We repeatedly apply
      these two steps until we converge to a smooth approximation of our original mesh as noted in class.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
      Loop subdivision implementation
    </h3>
    <h3>
      step 1: compute new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh
    </h3>
    <p>
      How I approached implementing loop subdivision was by following the recommended approach which was to first
      compute the positions of both new and old vertices using the original mesh. Within our
      MeshResampler::upsample(...) function I started with the suggested step 1 — which was computing the new positions
      for all the vertices in the input mesh using the Loop subdivision rule and storing them in Vertex::newPosition.
    </p>
    <p>
      To implement the first step I iterated through all the vertices in the mesh, where for each vertex I set up the n
      and u variables where n is the vertex degree and u is a constant which depends on the vertex degree. After
      obtaining these values I then initialized the vertex which would hold the sum of all original positions of
      neighboring vertex. And so, I obtained the current vertex’s halfedge that we are currently iterating on and use
      its half-edge to iterate over its neighboring vertex so that I can sum all the original positions of the
      neighboring vertices. I break the summation of the neighboring vertices into two cases, the case where the current
      vertex we are on is within the boundary and when it is not. When it is within the boundary I apply the following
      formula (1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum and when its not in the boundary I
      check the vertex’s half-edge twin and the vertex’s half-edge if they are within the boundary and take the vertex’s
      twin’s vertex’s position and add it to the original_neighbor_position_sum. Except In this case I apply the same
      formula as previously mentioned, but change the weights to reflect “new vertex” weights. If this was a mouthful, I
      must confess dear reader, that this was the step that took the most time, but moving forward, things got smoother.
    </p>
    <h3>
      step 2: compute the updated vertex positions associated with edges, and store it in Edge::newPosition
    </h3>
    <p>
      In this step I iterate through all the edges, selecting the appropriate half-edge associated the edge by checking
      whether the edge’s half-edge is within the boundary or its twin. Whichever half-edge is within the boundary we
      select that one. Using this information I obtain the the vertex positions of A, B, C and D to calculate the new
      vertex position. For those reading at home, what I’m implementing at this moment is calculating the position of a
      new vertex splitting the shared edge (A, B) between a pair of triangle (A, C, B) and (A, B, D). I take the vertex
      position of A, the current half-edge’s twin’s vertex position to obtain B and do two boundary checks to obtain the
      vertex C and D. With these 4 vertices I am able to apply the new vertex position formula 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C
      + D) and assign it to the current edge’s newPosition which we will acccess later on. In the case that the bounday
      checks fail, we simply treat the new vertex position as the midpoint between vertex A and vertex B. I end this
      portion of the code by explicitly labeling the edge as being part of the original mesh by labeling isNew to false
      for each edge that we iterate on.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step 3: Split every edge in the mesh, in any order
    </h3>
    <p>
      For this step, I went back to our splitEdge(...) function that I implemented in the previous task and refactored
      it to label the new edges that were created as new by setting their isNew value to true. To iterate over the
      correct number of edges, I observed that the design choice for where new edges are placed in the list always
      occured at the end, that is, new edges that were added to the mesh were always added at the end of the edges list.
      With this in mind, I took the number of edges using mesh.nEdges() to get the number of edges of the original mesh
      to set a hard upper bound of how many edges I would apply the splitEdge function to. And so I iterate through all
      the original mesh edges by calling mesh.edgesBegin() and iterate until I’ve split n edges, this guarantees that I
      do not split any new edges that have already been created due to the splitEdge(...) invokation itself. I will note
      that although the order of insertion of new edges and the order that I am processing them at the moment guarantees
      that they are part of the original mesh, the conditional check, that checks if the edge is not new is a redundancy
      check to safeguard in subsequent calls. But to wrap this step up, when I split the edge, it is at this step that I
      take the opportunity to use the newPosition that we calculated previously that was assigned to the current edge
      and applied it to the new midpoint vertex that we received from splitEdge(...) .
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step 4. Flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex
    </h3>
    <p>
      With the edges split from step 3, I proceeded to implement the step where we need to flip any edge that connects
      an old vertex to a new vertex. At this step I iterate through all the edges of the mesh, only checking the new
      edges if their isNew value is true. If these edges are new I then check their pair of vertices and check if this
      edge is composed of a new and old vertex, if this is the case, I invoke the mesh.flipEdge(...) function. At the
      end of this step I now have flipped all edges that connect an old and new vertex.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Step 5: Copy the new vertex positions into final Vertex::position
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that our edges have been split and flipped I now move on to iterating through all the vertices in the mesh to
      make our final update to their positions. I do this by only updating the positions of vertices whose isNew value
      is false. I do this because in step 3 where I am splitting every edge in the mesh, the splitEdge(...) function
      returns the midpoint vertex and in the same step we update that midpoint vertex’s position with the pre-calculated
      newPosition from the edge that we split on. Note that these are all new vertices that are returned from the
      splitEdge(...) function, which is why in this last step we can focus on assigning the new positions to the rest of
      the vertices that were part of the original mesh, that is, the vertices whose position attributes have not been
      updated yet.
    </p>
    <p>And that is how I implemented loop subdivision</p>
    <h3>
      Some interesting implementation/debugging tricks I used along the way
    </h3>
    <p>
      One debugging technique that I used was visualizing the mesh before and after any mesh operations, this was in
      addition to comparing the output of my loop subdivision function to the expected results that were given to us. I
      applied this approach when I resolved the following bug when applying loop subdivision to a cube.

    <p>
      As you can see, one of the edges were not flipped, this led me to immediately refactor the splitEdge(…) function,
      to ensure that I was setting the isNew value of the new vertices correctly along with the new edges.
    </p>
    <h3>Let's talk about how meshes behave after loop subdivision — what happens to sharp corners and edges?</h3>
    <p>
      When applying loop subdivision, depending on the topology of our mesh, the shape of our mesh will either differ
      from its original shape or mostly preserve its shape as we apply loop subdivision in subsequent meshes. That is,
      when we repeatedly aply loop subdivision, depending on the toplogy, we will either get a smooth approximation of
      our original mesh or produce a deviated smooth approximated version.

    <p>
      Lets take this cube for example, where when we apply loop subdivision twice, we see that the corners and edges in
      a sense “collapse” or are smoothed out. One observation that I came out from this is that, the topology of this
      cube, when one has less faces, one has less control over the structure of that comes after loop subdivision. That
      is, in a sense, loop subdivision, subdivides “within”, but in this cube, because the initial faces are so few and
      so close together that the splitting and flipping opereations from the initial step already create a completely
      new shape. It is almost as if it is subdividing “without”, that is - expanding. The less faces there are, the more
      influence the “noise” the initial edge mesh operations have.
    </p>
    <h3>How can we reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?</h3>
    <p>
      A different way of asking this question would be, how can we reduce the influence of the edge operations on the
      initial steps of loop subdivision? Intuitively, I asked the question — how can we add more structure? I think the
      conclusion that I came to was by pre-splitting edges, which meant, really, changing the initial topology one can
      have the loop subdivision smooth out the shape of mesh instead of modifying its shape entirely. That is, I simply
      added more faces, so that the loop subdivision is in a sense “contained” and I focused on pre-splitting on edges
      in the areas where I wanted to preserve the essense of the shape. In this case I illustrate this by taking the
      same cube, but modify its starting topology and then repeatedly apply loop subdivision twice.
